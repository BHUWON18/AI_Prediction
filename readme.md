# Real Madrid Match Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the performance of Real Madrid players based on historical match data. The model predicts whether a player will score more than 10 goals or not in a given season.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the player and team data used for the prediction model.
- `models/`: Stores the trained machine learning model (`best_model.pkl`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `reports/`: Text files with model performance reports.
- `ui/`: Contains the Flask app for making match predictions via a web interface.

## Setup

### Requirements

Install the necessary packages by running the following command:
