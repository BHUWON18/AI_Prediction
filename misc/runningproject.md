Step 1: Set Up the Environment

    Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from here.

    Install Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):
        You can create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated.
        Run the following command in your project folder:

python -m venv venv

Activate Virtual Environment:

    On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

    On MacOS/Linux:

    source venv/bin/activate

Step 2: Install Dependencies

    In the project folder, use the requirements.txt file to install all necessary Python packages.
        Run the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Set Up the Project Files

    Ensure all the necessary files are in place:
        Place all your datasets (laliga_player_assists.csv, laliga_player_passes.csv, etc.) inside the data/ folder.
        Make sure the machine learning model (best_model.pkl) is in the models/ folder.
        If any pre-trained model exists, ensure it is placed in the correct location.

    Check your config.py:
        Make sure the paths in config.py point to the correct directories for data/, models/, and reports/.
        You can adjust the DEBUG_MODE setting based on whether you need to run the Flask app in development mode.

Step 4: Run the Jupyter Notebooks (Optional for Exploration and Analysis)

    Start Jupyter Notebook:
        Run the following command in your project directory:

    jupyter notebook

        This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser.

    Run the Notebooks in Order:
        01_data_exploration.ipynb: Explore the datasets and visualize the data.
        02_feature_engineering.ipynb: Apply feature engineering techniques to create new features that will help the model.
        03_model_training.ipynb: Train your machine learning model using the processed data.
        04_evaluation.ipynb: Evaluate your trained model, analyze the results, and tune if necessary.

Step 5: Train the Model (If Not Already Trained)

    Train the Model:
        If the model isn’t pre-trained (best_model.pkl), run the train_model.py script to train the model.
        You can do this from the command line:

    python src/train_model.py

    Ensure the Model is Saved:
        After training, the model should be saved as best_model.pkl in the models/ folder. This is the model that will be used in the Flask app for making predictions.

Step 6: Run the Flask Web App (UI for Match Prediction)

    Navigate to the ui/ folder:
        Go to the ui/ folder in the terminal.

cd ui

Run the Flask App:

    Start the Flask app by running the following command:

python app.py

Open the App in Your Browser:

    Once the Flask app starts, open your browser and go to:

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

    Use the Prediction Interface:
        On the main page (index.html), you should be able to input match data and predict the performance of a Real Madrid player for that match.

Step 7: Generate Model Performance Report

    Run Evaluation:
        After evaluating your model (in 04_evaluation.ipynb), the results should be saved in reports/model_performance.txt. You can open it to view model metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Step 8: Make Predictions (via Flask App or Command Line)

    Using the Web Interface:
        Input match data into the Flask web interface and hit "Predict" to get the result.

    Using Command Line:
        You can also make predictions programmatically using the predict.py script (if you have such a script in src/).

Step 9: Review and Improve the Model (Optional)

    If you want to improve your model:
        Go back to the Jupyter notebooks.
        Try different feature engineering techniques.
        Tune the model by adjusting parameters.
        Retrain the model and save the updated version as best_model.pkl.

Step 10: Share the Project

    Share with Others:
        You can share the project by uploading it to a GitHub repository.
        If you need to deploy the Flask app to a cloud server (like Heroku), follow the appropriate deployment documentation.

Summary of Steps:

    Set up the environment and install dependencies.
    Place the necessary files (data, model) in the correct folders.
    Optionally run the Jupyter notebooks to explore and analyze the data.
    Train the model (if needed).
    Run the Flask app for the UI and make match predictions.
    Review the model’s performance and adjust it if needed.

With these steps, you should be able to successfully run and use your Real Madrid Match Prediction project!
